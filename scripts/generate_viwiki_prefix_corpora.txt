Here's what I did, starting from viwiki_restricted:
1) Compute the probability of each word.
2) Remove all Vietnamese words that are also English.
3) Group same words.
4) Use mt.pandas.word to split each Vietnamese word into a form where all the tone and diacritical marks are split. This forms the split1 corpus before computing prefixes.
5) Move the first tone mark of each word to the end of the word, if the tone mark exists. This forms the splitL corpus before computing prefixes.
6) Use mt.pandas.word to truncate at the first occurence of any tone or diacritical mark, of both corpora. This step forms Vietnamese prefixes for each corpus.
7) Group same prefixes.
